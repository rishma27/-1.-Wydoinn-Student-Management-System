Methodology – Student Management System
The methodology adopted for developing the Student Management System (SMS) involves a structured, step-by-step approach, focusing on planning, designing, coding, testing, and maintaining the application. The system is developed using the Python programming language and basic file handling for data persistence.

Requirement Analysis:
The first step involves understanding the essential functionalities needed in a student management system. This includes managing student records, attendance tracking, grade calculation, and user interaction.

System Design:
The system was designed to be menu-driven for ease of use. Each function (add, view, update, delete) was mapped to specific menu options. A modular approach was chosen to maintain clean and reusable code.

Data Structure:
A text file (students.txt) is used for storing student records. Each record contains a student's roll number, name, and grade, stored in a comma-separated format.

Function Definitions:
Separate Python functions were created for each operation:

add_student() – to add new student data.

view_students() – to display all student records.

search_student() – to find a student by roll number.

update_student() – to modify existing records.

delete_student() – to remove student data.

User Interface:
A command-line interface (CLI) is implemented using a loop and conditional statements to guide users through the options. The interface is simple and beginner-friendly.

File Handling:
Python’s built-in file handling methods (open, read, write, append) are used to manage persistent data. The data is read from and written to the file as required during operations.

Testing & Debugging:
Each function was individually tested to ensure correct behavior. Input validation and error handling (like missing files or invalid input) were added to make the system more robust.

Iterative Development:
Enhancements were made based on feedback. For example, confirmation messages were added after each successful operation. The search and update logic was optimized for better performance.

Documentation:
Proper comments were included in the code to explain logic and improve readability. A user guide was also prepared to help new users interact with the system.

Future Scope:
The methodology allows for future improvements such as:

Integrating a GUI using Tkinter

Switching to a relational database (like SQLite or MySQL)

Adding login authentication for admin access

Scalability:
The modular design ensures that the system can be easily extended by adding new features (e.g., fee tracking, timetable management) without major structural changes.

Maintenance:
Since the system is file-based, updates are as simple as modifying or replacing the text file. Regular backups are recommended to prevent data loss.
